"""
This module implements the required classes to emit logs in the
watchers.

All the :mod:`pymongo.watcher` modules use a singleton instance of
:class:`WatchLogEmitter` class returned by :func:`get_log_emitter` to
emit logs which internally emit logs by leveraging python
:class:`logging`. The :func:`log` function is also available as a
syntactic sugar for the emitter instance :meth:`log` method.

.. note:: Maybe "logging" was the proper name for this module, but to
   prevent confusion with the python :class:`logging` class, the name
   "logger" seems more appropriate.
