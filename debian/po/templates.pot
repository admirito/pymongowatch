"Pymongowatch is always accessible in a python application by importing "
"pymongo.watcher sub-package. But sometimes you are not the author of a "
"python program source code and you still want to use pymongowatch logging "
"capabilities. In this case you can install \"pymongo mask\" to achieve this "

"Pymongo mask, is a fake pymongo module which has to be installed on a higher "
"priority sys.path than the real pymongo. It will use the real package as the "
"backend and provide all the features as the real pymongo but it will enable "
"pymongowatch by default. So applications unaware of pymognowatch can "
"leverage its logging mechanism."
