_Description: Install path for pymongo mask:
 Pymongowatch is always accessible in a python application by
 importing pymongo.watcher sub-package. But sometimes you are not the
 author of a python program source code and you still want to use
 pymongowatch logging capabilities. In this case you can install
 "pymongo mask" to achieve this ability.
 .
 Pymongo mask, is a fake pymongo module which has to be installed on a
 higher priority sys.path than the real pymongo. It will use the real
 package as the backend and provide all the features as the real
 pymongo but it will enable pymongowatch by default. So applications
 unaware of pymognowatch can leverage its logging mechanism.
 .
 Choose a path for pymongo mask installation, "custom" for entering an
 arbitrary path or "none" to skip installation of pymongo mask.
